# pi-power-button - 3 seconds delay

## Details

This software allows to turn on and off your raspberry. For turning off the raspberry you will need to hold the button for 3seconds. This makes unintentional turn offs or static current not turn off the raspberry randomly.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/ImpressiveTaste/pi-power-button`
1. Optional: Edit line 9/10 in listen-for-shutdown.py to your preferred pin (Please see "Is it possible to use another pin other than Pin 5 (GPIO 3/SCL)?" below!)
1. Run the setup script: `./pi-power-button/script/install`

## Uninstallation

If you need to uninstall the power button script in order to use GPIO3 for another project or something:

1. Run the uninstall script: `./pi-power-button/script/uninstall`

## Hardware

A full list of what you'll need can be found [here](https://howchoo.com/g/mwnlytk3zmm/how-to-add-a-power-button-to-your-raspberry-pi#parts-list). At a minimum, you'll need a normally-open (NO) power button, some jumper wires, and a soldering iron. If you _don't_ have a soldering iron or don't feel like breaking it out, you can use [this prebuilt button](https://howchoo.com/shop/product/prebuilt-raspberry-pi-power-button?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=git-repo-readme) instead.

Connect the power button to Pin 5 (GPIO 3/SCL) and Pin 6 (GND) as shown in this diagram:

### Is it possible to use another pin other than Pin 5 (GPIO 3/SCL)?

Not for full functionality, no. There are two main features of the power button:

1. **Shutdown functionality:** Shut the Pi down safely when the button is pressed. The Pi now consumes zero power.
1. **Wake functionality:** Turn the Pi back on when the button is pressed again.

The **wake functionality** requires the SCL pin, Pin 5 (GPIO 3). There's simply no other pin that can "hardware" wake the Pi from a zero-power state. If you don't care about turning the Pi back _on_ using the power button, you could use a different GPIO pin for the **shutdown functionality** and still have a working shutdown button. Then, to turn the Pi back on, you'll just need to disconnect and reconnect power (or use a cord with a physical switch in it) to "wake" the Pi.

Of course, for the GND connection, you can use [any other ground pin you want](https://pinout.xyz/).

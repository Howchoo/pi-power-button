1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Howchoo/pi-power-button.git`

## Hardware

A full list of what you'll need can be found [here](https://howchoo.com/g/mwnlytk3zmm/how-to-add-a-power-button-to-your-raspberry-pi#parts-list). At a minimum, you'll need a normally-open (NO) power button, some jumper wires, and a soldering iron. If you _don't_ have a soldering iron or don't feel like breaking it out, you can use [this prebuilt button](https://howchoo.com/shop/product/prebuilt-raspberry-pi-power-button) instead.

Connect the power button to Pin 5 (SCL) and Pi 6 (GND) as shown in this diagram:
